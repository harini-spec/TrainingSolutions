## Employee Request Tracker
The employee request tracker system comprises two main dashboards: the user dashboard, accessible to all employees, and the admin dashboard. Within the user dashboard, employees can submit requests, track their progress, and communicate with administrators. Meanwhile, the admin dashboard is divided into user and admin sections. The user section mirrors the functionalities available to employees but with additional capabilities for managing requests. In contrast, the admin section provides comprehensive oversight, allowing administrators to view all requests, provide solutions, and close requests.
