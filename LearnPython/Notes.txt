Naming convention:
    For variables and functions, use lowercase with underscores (snake_case). 
    For classes, use CamelCase.

String formatting:
    msg: str = 'Something'
    print(f'{msg:*>20}') # O/P: ***********Something (totally 20 chars, something = 9, 11 * before something)
    print(f'{msg:*<20}') # O/P: Something***********

Class:
    Class instantiation uses function notation - x = MyClass()
    constructor : def __init__():{}

What is SELF in Python? 
    SELF represents the instance of class. 
    This handy keyword allows you to access variables, attributes, and methods of a defined class in Python

Types of variable:
    Class variable - like static variable 
        - defined in class, outside methods 
        - common to all objects
        - Changes made to the class variable affect all instances
    Instance variable 
        - defined in constructor 
        - diff for each object 
        - Changes made to the instance variable does not affect all instances 
    Once we make changes to class variable inside a method like setting a value - it becomes an instance variable 

Using Super() in multiple inheritance:
    - overwrites all the values
